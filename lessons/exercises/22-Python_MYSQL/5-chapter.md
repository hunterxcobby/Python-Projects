**What is a Cursor:**

In database programming, a cursor is a mechanism that allows you to navigate and manipulate the results of a query. It acts as a pointer or an iterator, enabling you to traverse the rows returned by a query one by one.

**Why Use a Cursor:**

1. **Iteration:** A cursor allows you to iterate through the results of a query, fetching one row at a time. This is especially important when dealing with large result sets to avoid loading the entire dataset into memory at once.

2. **Transaction Support:** Cursors are often associated with a transaction. When you perform operations like SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, or DELETE, these changes are made through a cursor. The cursor helps manage these operations in the context of a transaction.

3. **Data Manipulation:** Cursors are used to execute SQL statements and retrieve the results. They provide methods to fetch rows, execute queries, and manage the state of the result set.

4. **Isolation:** Cursors can provide isolation between different parts of your program or different threads. Each cursor operates independently, allowing multiple parts of your code to work with different aspects of the database concurrently.

**Example Use of a Cursor:**

Let's say you have a table named 'employees' with columns 'id', 'name', and 'salary'. You want to fetch all the names of employees with a salary greater than a certain threshold using a cursor:

```python
# Assuming 'db' is your MySQL database connection
cur = db.cursor()

# Execute a query
cur.execute("SELECT name FROM employees WHERE salary > %s", (threshold_salary,))

# Fetch all rows
result_set = cur.fetchall()

# Process the result set
for row in result_set:
    print(row[0])  # Assuming 'name' is the first column in the result set
```

Here, the cursor allows you to execute the query, fetch the results, and iterate through the rows. It provides a way to interact with the database in a controlled and efficient manner.

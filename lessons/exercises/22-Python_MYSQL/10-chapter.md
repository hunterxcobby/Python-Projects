**Failure to Clean Up:**

When you fail to clean up by not closing open cursors and database connections, you may encounter several issues:

1. **Resource Leakage:** Each open cursor and database connection consumes system resources. Failing to close them can lead to resource leakage, causing your application to use more memory than necessary.

2. **Database Connection Limits:** Depending on your database server's configuration, there might be a limit on the number of simultaneous connections. Not closing connections could exhaust this limit, preventing new connections and potentially causing your application to fail.

3. **Performance Impact:** Leaving open connections might impact the performance of your application over time, especially in long-running processes or applications handling a high volume of database interactions.

4. **Data Integrity Issues:** In some cases, not closing connections properly could result in uncommitted transactions, leading to potential data integrity issues if your application relies on a consistent database state.

To avoid these problems, it's good practice to always close cursors and connections promptly after you've finished using them. This ensures efficient resource utilization and helps maintain the stability and reliability of your application.

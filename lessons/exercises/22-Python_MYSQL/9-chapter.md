**Clean Up:**

Cleaning up is a straightforward process. Ensure you close all open cursors and database connections. Each cursor and database connection has a 'close' function, so call this for each instance you have created.

```python
# Close all cursors
cur.close()
# Close all databases
db.close()
```

Closing cursors and connections is essential to release resources and maintain the integrity of your database interactions. This step is particularly crucial when your script has finished its operations or if you're running multiple queries sequentially.

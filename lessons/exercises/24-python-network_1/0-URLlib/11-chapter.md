To handle proxies in Python's `urllib.request` module, you can customize the ProxyHandler to suit your needs. Here's a simple guide on how to set up your own ProxyHandler with no proxies defined:

1. **Create ProxyHandler**: Instantiate a `ProxyHandler` object, passing an empty dictionary `{}` as an argument. This indicates that no proxies are defined.

2. **Create Opener**: Build an opener (`OpenerDirector` instance) using `build_opener()`, passing the `ProxyHandler`.

3. **Install Opener**: Install the opener using `install_opener(opener)`. This sets the installed opener as the default opener for all subsequent URL fetches.

By following these steps, you can customize proxy handling in Python's `urllib.request` module to suit your specific requirements.

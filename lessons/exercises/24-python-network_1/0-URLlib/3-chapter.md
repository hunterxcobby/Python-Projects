Let's break down the process of sending data to a URL using `urllib.request`:

1. **Sending Data with POST Requests**:
   - Sometimes you need to send data to a URL, typically when interacting with a web application or a CGI script.
   - This is commonly done using a POST request, similar to how your browser sends data when you submit a form on a website.
   - You encode the data using the `urllib.parse.urlencode()` function to convert it into a format suitable for transmission.
   - Example:
     ```python
     import urllib.parse
     import urllib.request

     url = 'http://www.someserver.com/cgi-bin/register.cgi'
     values = {'name': 'Michael Foord',
               'location': 'Northampton',
               'language': 'Python'}

     data = urllib.parse.urlencode(values)
     data = data.encode('ascii')  # Convert data to bytes
     req = urllib.request.Request(url, data)
     with urllib.request.urlopen(req) as response:
        the_page = response.read()
     ```

2. **GET Requests vs POST Requests**:
   - If you don't provide the `data` argument, `urllib` defaults to using a GET request instead of a POST request.
   - GET requests typically don't have side-effects, meaning they don't change the state of the system.
   - However, POST requests can have side-effects, such as submitting a form or placing an order on a website.
   - Data can also be passed in a GET request by encoding it in the URL itself.
   - Example:
     ```python
     import urllib.parse
     import urllib.request

     data = {'name': 'Somebody Here',
             'location': 'Northampton',
             'language': 'Python'}

     url_values = urllib.parse.urlencode(data)
     url = 'http://www.example.com/example.cgi'
     full_url = url + '?' + url_values
     data = urllib.request.urlopen(full_url)
     ```

In summary, `urllib.request` provides a convenient way to send data to a URL using POST requests. You can encode the data using `urllib.parse.urlencode()` and pass it as the `data` argument when creating a `Request` object. Alternatively, you can include the data in the URL itself for GET requests.

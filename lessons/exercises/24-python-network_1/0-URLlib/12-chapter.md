In Python, the process of fetching web resources is organized into layers. The `urllib` module utilizes the `http.client` library, which, in turn, relies on the `socket` library for networking operations.

Starting from Python 2.3, you have the ability to set a timeout for socket operations, which can be crucial in scenarios where your application needs to retrieve web content. By default, sockets have no timeout, which can lead to potential hanging issues. While the timeout feature is not directly exposed in higher-level modules like `http.client` or `urllib.request`, you can set a global default timeout for all sockets using the `socket.setdefaulttimeout(timeout)` function. This timeout value, specified in seconds, will then be applied to all socket operations, including those initiated by `urllib.request`.

When you type "google.com" into your browser and press Enter, several steps occur at the application level to initiate and complete the process of accessing the Google website:

1. **Domain Name Resolution (DNS Lookup):**
   - Your browser first needs to resolve the domain name "google.com" to an IP address. It sends a Domain Name System (DNS) query to a DNS resolver server.
   - The DNS resolver server checks its cache to see if it already knows the IP address for "google.com". If not, it recursively queries other DNS servers until it finds the IP address associated with the domain name.
   - Once the IP address is resolved, the DNS resolver server sends it back to your browser.

2. **Establishing a TCP Connection:**
   - Your browser initiates a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection to the IP address obtained from the DNS lookup.
   - TCP is responsible for establishing a reliable connection between your browser and the Google server.

3. **Sending an HTTP Request:**
   - Once the TCP connection is established, your browser sends an HTTP GET request to the IP address, requesting the homepage of the Google website.
   - The HTTP request includes headers such as Host, User-Agent, Accept, and more, which provide additional information to the server about the request.

4. **Server Processing:**
   - The Google server receives the HTTP request from your browser and processes it.
   - The server retrieves the requested homepage content, typically an HTML document, and any associated resources (such as CSS stylesheets, JavaScript files, images, etc.) if needed.

5. **Sending an HTTP Response:**
   - After processing the request, the Google server sends back an HTTP response to your browser.
   - The HTTP response contains the requested content, along with response headers such as Content-Type, Content-Length, and others.

6. **Rendering the Webpage:**
   - Your browser receives the HTTP response and begins to render the webpage based on the HTML content.
   - It parses the HTML document, executes any embedded JavaScript code, and applies CSS styles to display the webpage as intended.

7. **Additional Requests (Optional):**
   - The rendered webpage may include additional resources referenced in the HTML document, such as images, scripts, or stylesheets.
   - Your browser may send additional HTTP requests to fetch these resources from the Google server or other servers as needed.

8. **Displaying the Webpage:**
   - Finally, your browser displays the fully rendered Google homepage, allowing you to interact with it, perform searches, and access various services provided by Google.

Throughout this process, various protocols and technologies work together at the application level to facilitate communication between your browser and the Google server, ultimately enabling you to access and interact with the Google website.

The `Set-Cookie` and `Cookie` headers play crucial roles in managing cookies between the server and the client (your browser). Let's break down how they work:

1. **Set-Cookie Header:**
   - When you visit a website, the server can send cookies to your browser using the `Set-Cookie` header in the HTTP response.
   - The `Set-Cookie` header contains key-value pairs representing the cookies to be stored by your browser.
   - Each cookie consists of a name-value pair, such as `<cookie-name>=<cookie-value>`.
   - For example, `Set-Cookie: yummy_cookie=choco` and `Set-Cookie: tasty_cookie=strawberry` instruct your browser to store two cookies named `yummy_cookie` with the value `choco` and `tasty_cookie` with the value `strawberry`, respectively.

2. **Cookie Header:**
   - When your browser sends subsequent requests to the server, it includes all previously stored cookies in the `Cookie` header.
   - The `Cookie` header contains all the cookies associated with the current domain.
   - Each cookie is represented as `<cookie-name>=<cookie-value>` pairs separated by semicolons.
   - For example, `Cookie: yummy_cookie=choco; tasty_cookie=strawberry` tells the server that your browser has stored two cookies named `yummy_cookie` with the value `choco` and `tasty_cookie` with the value `strawberry`.

3. **Usage in Server-Side Applications:**
   - Server-side applications use the `Set-Cookie` header to send cookies to the client.
   - Depending on the programming language or framework used, the syntax for setting cookies may vary:
     - In PHP, you can set cookies using the `setcookie()` function.

     - In Node.js, you can set cookies using libraries like `cookie` or `express`.

     - In Python, you can set cookies using the `Set-Cookie` header in the HTTP response.

     - In Ruby on Rails, you can set cookies using the `cookies` hash.

Understanding how the `Set-Cookie` and `Cookie` headers work is essential for managing stateful information between the server and the client in web applications.

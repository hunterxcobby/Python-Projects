### GENERAL OBJECTIVES

1. **What a URL is:**
   - A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a reference to a web resource that specifies its location and how to access it on the internet. It typically consists of several components, including the protocol (such as HTTP or HTTPS), the domain name or IP address of the server hosting the resource, the path to the specific resource on the server, and optional parameters.

2. **What HTTP is:**
   - HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, and hypermedia information systems. It is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web. HTTP functions as a request-response protocol in the client-server computing model. Clients submit HTTP requests to servers, and servers respond to those requests.

3. **How to read a URL:**
   - Reading a URL involves understanding its different components:
     - **Protocol**: Specifies the communication protocol being used, such as HTTP or HTTPS.
     - **Domain**: Indicates the domain name or IP address of the server hosting the resource.
     - **Port**: Optionally specifies the port number on the server to connect to. If not specified, default ports are used (80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS).
     - **Path**: Specifies the location of the specific resource on the server.
     - **Parameters**: Additional data that may be sent to the server, usually in the form of key-value pairs, separated by "&" symbols.
     - **Fragment**: An optional part of the URL that specifies a specific section within the resource being requested.
   
4. **The scheme for an HTTP URL:**
   - The scheme for an HTTP URL indicates the protocol being used to access the resource. In a typical HTTP URL, the scheme is "http://" followed by the domain name or IP address of the server. For example:
     ```
     http://www.example.com/
     ```
     In this URL, "http" is the scheme, indicating the use of the HTTP protocol.

Understanding these concepts is fundamental to working with web technologies and navigating the internet effectively

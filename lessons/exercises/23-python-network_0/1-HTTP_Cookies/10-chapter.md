1. **What an HTTP request method is:**
   - An HTTP request method is a verb that defines the action to be performed on a resource identified by a URL. The HTTP protocol defines several request methods, each serving a different purpose. Some common HTTP request methods include:
     - **GET**: Requests data from a specified resource. It should only retrieve data and should not have any other effect.
     - **POST**: Submits data to be processed to a specified resource. The data is included in the body of the request.
     - **PUT**: Uploads a representation of the specified resource, replacing any existing representation of the resource.
     - **DELETE**: Deletes the specified resource.
     - **PATCH**: Applies partial modifications to a resource.
     - **HEAD**: Requests the headers that would be returned if the HEAD request's URL were instead requested with the GET method.
     - **OPTIONS**: Returns the HTTP methods that the server supports for the specified URL.
   - The choice of request method depends on the desired action and the semantics of the operation being performed. For example, GET is typically used for fetching resources, POST for submitting data, PUT for updating resources, and DELETE for removing resources.

2. **What an HTTP response status code is:**
   - An HTTP response status code is a three-digit numeric code sent by a server in response to a client's request. It indicates the outcome of the request and provides information about the status of the response. Each status code falls into one of five categories, based on the first digit:
     - **1xx (Informational)**: Indicates a provisional response and requires the client to take action.
     - **2xx (Success)**: Indicates that the request was successful and the server fulfilled the client's request.
     - **3xx (Redirection)**: Indicates that further action needs to be taken by the client to complete the request.
     - **4xx (Client Error)**: Indicates that the client has sent a malformed request or the request cannot be fulfilled.
     - **5xx (Server Error)**: Indicates that the server failed to fulfill a valid request due to an error on the server's side.
   - Some common HTTP response status codes include:
     - **200 OK**: The request has succeeded.
     - **404 Not Found**: The server cannot find the requested resource.
     - **500 Internal Server Error**: The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
   - Status codes provide valuable information about the outcome of an HTTP request and help both clients and servers understand and handle the request effectively.

Understanding HTTP request methods and response status codes is fundamental to working with the HTTP protocol and building web applications.

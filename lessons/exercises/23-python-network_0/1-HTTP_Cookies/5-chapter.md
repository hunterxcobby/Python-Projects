The `Domain` and `Path` attributes of a cookie define where the cookie should be sent:

1. **Domain Attribute:**
   - The `Domain` attribute specifies the domain for which the cookie is valid.
   - When the browser sends a request to a domain, it includes all cookies that match the domain specified in the request.
   - If the `Domain` attribute is not specified, the cookie is only sent to the domain that set it.
   - If the `Domain` attribute is specified, the cookie is sent to that domain and all its subdomains.

2. **Path Attribute:**
   - The `Path` attribute specifies the subset of URLs within a domain for which the cookie is valid.
   - When the browser sends a request to a URL within the specified path, it includes all cookies that match the path.
   - If the `Path` attribute is not specified, the cookie is only sent to URLs within the directory of the page that set it.
   - If the `Path` attribute is specified, the cookie is sent to URLs within that path and its subdirectories.

Example of setting a cookie with both `Domain` and `Path` attributes in Python with Flask:

```python
from flask import Flask, make_response

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def set_cookie():
    response = make_response("Setting cookie")
    response.set_cookie('id', 'a3fWa', domain='.example.com', path='/path')
    return response

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

In this example, the `domain='.example.com'` and `path='/path'` parameters in `set_cookie()` method set the `Domain` and `Path` attributes for the cookie, respectively. This means that the cookie will be sent to all URLs within the `.example.com` domain and its subdomains, under the `/path` directory.

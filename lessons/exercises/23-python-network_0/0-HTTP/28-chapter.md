The TRACE request method allows a client to receive a diagnostic trace of the request as seen by the server. It's mainly used for debugging and understanding how intermediate servers process requests.

The syntax for a TRACE request is simple:

```
TRACE / HTTP-version
(blank line)
```

Here's an example of a TRACE request sent through a proxy server:

```
TRACE http://www.amazon.com/ HTTP/1.1
Host: www.amazon.com
Connection: Close
(blank line)
```

And the corresponding response from the server:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Date: Fri, 27 Feb 2004 09:44:21 GMT
Content-Type: message/http
Connection: close
Server: Stronghold/2.4.2 Apache/1.3.6 C2NetEU/2412 (Unix)
Connection: close
Via: 1.1 xproxy (NetCache NetApp/5.3.1R4D5)
   
9d
TRACE / HTTP/1.1
Connection: keep-alive
Host: www.amazon.com
Via: 1.1 xproxy (NetCache NetApp/5.3.1R4D5)
X-Forwarded-For: 155.69.185.59, 155.69.5.234
   
0
```

In this response, the server provides a trace of the request, including the HTTP method, headers, and any modifications made by intermediate servers. This information can be useful for diagnosing issues or understanding the behavior of proxy servers.

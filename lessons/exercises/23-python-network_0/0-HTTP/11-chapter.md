URI stands for Uniform Resource Identifier. It is a string of characters used to identify a resource on the internet. 

In the context of HTTP requests, the URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) specifies the location of the resource being requested. It is composed of several components:

1. **Scheme**: Indicates the protocol used to access the resource (e.g., http, https, ftp).
2. **Authority**: Typically includes the hostname or IP address of the server hosting the resource, and optionally the port number.
3. **Path**: Specifies the location of the resource within the server's directory structure.
4. **Query**: Contains additional parameters or data to be passed to the server, typically used in GET requests.
5. **Fragment**: Identifies a specific portion of the resource, often used in conjunction with HTML documents.

For example, in the URI "https://www.example.com/products?id=123", 
- The scheme is "https",
- The authority is "www.example.com",
- The path is "/products",
- The query is "?id=123".

Together, the URI provides a unique address for accessing a specific resource on the web.

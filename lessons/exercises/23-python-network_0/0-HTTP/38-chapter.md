The "Accept-Ranges: bytes" header indicates that the server supports byte-range requests, which means clients can request specific portions of a resource by specifying a byte range in the request header.

The "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" header indicates that the server is using chunked transfer encoding to send the response body in a series of chunks. This allows for streaming of data without the need to know the total size of the response upfront.

Together, these headers enable clients to request specific byte ranges of a resource and receive the response in manageable chunks, facilitating efficient handling of large files and supporting features like resuming downloads.

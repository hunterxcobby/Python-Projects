The POST request method is utilized to send additional data to the server, such as HTML form data or file uploads. Unlike the GET request triggered by clicking links in browsers, POST requests are typically initiated through HTML forms with the method attribute set to "post" or by custom network programs.

POST requests follow this syntax:

```
POST request-URI HTTP-version
Content-Type: mime-type
Content-Length: number-of-bytes
(other optional request headers)

(URL-encoded query string)
```

In a POST request, the URL-encoded query string is sent in the request body instead of being appended to the request-URI. Essential headers like Content-Type and Content-Length are necessary to inform the server about the media type and the length of the request body.

For example, when a user submits a form with the POST method:

```html
<form method="post" action="/bin/login">
    Username: <input type="text" name="user" size="25" /><br />
    Password: <input type="password" name="pw" size="10" /><br /><br />
    <input type="hidden" name="action" value="login" />
    <input type="submit" value="SEND" />
</form>
```

If the user enters "Peter Lee" as the username and "123456" as the password, the browser generates the following POST request:

```
POST /bin/login HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:8000
Accept: image/gif, image/jpeg, */*
Referer: http://127.0.0.1:8000/login.html
Accept-Language: en-us
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)
Content-Length: 37
Connection: Keep-Alive
Cache-Control: no-cache
   
User=Peter+Lee&pw=123456&action=login
```

Here, the Content-Type header specifies the data is URL-encoded, and the Content-Length header indicates the length of the request body.

In comparison with GET requests for submitting form data, POST requests offer advantages such as:

- Unlimited data posting capability since the data is sent in the request body.
- Query string confidentiality as it is not displayed in the browser's address bar.

However, it's crucial to note that although passwords are not visible in the address bar, they are transmitted in clear text and can be intercepted through network sniffing, making POST requests insecure for transmitting sensitive information like passwords.

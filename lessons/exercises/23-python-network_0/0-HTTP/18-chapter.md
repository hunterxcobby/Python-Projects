### More HTTP/1.0 GET Request Examples:

#### Example: Misspelt Request Method
In this example, the request method "GET" is misspelled as "get". The server responds with an error "501 Method Not Implemented". The response header "Allow" informs the client of the allowed methods.

#### Example: 404 File Not Found
This example demonstrates a GET request for a resource "/t.html" that cannot be found. The server returns an error "404 Not Found".

#### Example: Wrong HTTP Version Number
The HTTP-version is misspelled, resulting in bad syntax. The server responds with an error "400 Bad Request".

#### Example: Wrong Request-URI
The request-URI does not begin with "/", resulting in a "bad request". The server responds with an error "400 Bad Request".

#### Example: Keep-Alive Connection
This example shows a request with "Connection: Keep-Alive" header to maintain the TCP connection. The server includes "Connection: Keep-Alive" in the response to allow further requests through the same connection.

#### Example: Accessing a Protected Resource
Attempting to access a protected resource ("/forbidden/index.html") results in a "403 Forbidden" error. The server denies access to the resource due to permission restrictions.

Understanding these examples helps in grasping how servers respond to different types of HTTP/1.0 GET requests, including errors and status codes.

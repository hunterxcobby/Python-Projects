Character set negotiation in HTTP allows clients to specify their preferred character sets using the "Accept-Charset" header in the request, and servers to respond with content encoded in the most suitable character set.

Here's how it works:

1. **Client Request**: The client includes an "Accept-Charset" header in its request, listing the character sets it can handle in order of preference.

2. **Server Processing**: Upon receiving the request, the server evaluates the "Accept-Charset" header and compares it with the available character sets for the requested resource.

3. **Character Set Selection**: The server selects the most appropriate character set from the client's preferences and the available character sets for the resource.

4. **Response**: The server includes a "Content-Type" header in the response, specifying the selected character set for the content.

Example:

- If a client sends an "Accept-Charset: utf-8, iso-8859-1" header, indicating a preference for UTF-8 encoding followed by ISO-8859-1 (Latin-I), and the server has content available in both UTF-8 and ISO-8859-1, the server selects UTF-8 and includes a "Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8" header in the response.

Relevant Configuration Directives:

- **AddCharset**: Associates file extensions with specific character sets, allowing the server to recognize the character encoding of resources.

By leveraging character set negotiation, HTTP enables clients and servers to communicate effectively by selecting compatible character encodings based on their capabilities and preferences.

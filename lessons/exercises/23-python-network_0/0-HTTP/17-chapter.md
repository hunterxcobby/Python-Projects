### Response Status Codes Overview:

HTTP response status codes provide information about the outcome of a request. They are categorized into several groups based on their first digit:

- **1xx (Informational):** Request received, server continues the process.
- **2xx (Success):** Request successfully received, understood, accepted, and serviced.
- **3xx (Redirection):** Further action required to complete the request.
- **4xx (Client Error):** Request contains bad syntax or cannot be understood.
- **5xx (Server Error):** Server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request.

#### Commonly Encountered Status Codes:

- **100 Continue:** Server received the request and is in the process of giving the response.
- **200 OK:** Request fulfilled successfully.
- **301 Move Permanently:** Resource permanently moved to a new location. Client should update references.
- **302 Found (Redirect):** New location is temporary; client should issue a new request.
- **304 Not Modified:** Resource not modified since the last request.
- **400 Bad Request:** Server could not interpret the request.
- **401 Authentication Required:** Resource protected, requires client credentials.
- **403 Forbidden:** Server refuses to supply the resource.
- **404 Not Found:** Requested resource cannot be found.

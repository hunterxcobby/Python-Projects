The HTTP CONNECT request method serves the purpose of establishing a connection through a proxy server to another host, primarily for relaying content without parsing or caching the message. This method is commonly employed for creating secure connections, such as those used in HTTPS tunnels.

Regarding other request methods:

1. **PUT**: This method is utilized to instruct the server to store the provided data at the specified location.

2. **DELETE**: Used to request the removal of the specified resource from the server.

However, it's crucial to note that due to security considerations, many production servers do not support PUT and DELETE methods by default.

Additionally, HTTP allows for extension methods, error codes, and headers to be defined, thereby extending the functionality of the protocol. These extensions enable customization and adaptation of HTTP to suit specific application requirements.

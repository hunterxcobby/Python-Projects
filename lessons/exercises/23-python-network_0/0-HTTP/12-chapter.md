### HTTP Response Message Structure:

An HTTP response message consists of three main parts: the status line, response headers, and an optional message body.

#### Status Line:
- The status line is the first line of the response message and contains three components separated by spaces: the HTTP version, status code, and reason phrase.
- The HTTP version specifies the version of the HTTP protocol used in the response.
- The status code is a three-digit number that indicates the outcome of the request. Common status codes include 200 for OK, 404 for Not Found, 403 for Forbidden, and 500 for Internal Server Error.
- The reason phrase provides a human-readable explanation of the status code.

#### Response Headers:
- Response headers provide additional information about the response, such as the content type, content length, and connection details.
- Each header consists of a name-value pair separated by a colon (:).
- Multiple values for a single header can be specified by separating them with commas.

#### Message Body (Optional):
- The message body contains the data associated with the response, such as the requested resource or an error message.
- The presence and format of the message body depend on the status code and the specific requirements of the client receiving the response.

#### Example:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Sun, 28 Nov 2021 12:00:00 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.38 (Ubuntu)
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 35
Connection: close

<html><body><h1>Hello World!</h1></body></html>
```

In this example, the status line indicates a successful response (status code 200) with the reason phrase "OK". The response headers provide additional information such as the server type, content type, content length, and connection details. The message body contains the HTML content "<html><body><h1>Hello World!</h1></body></html>".

### Conclusion:

Understanding the structure of an HTTP response message is essential for developing web applications and interpreting server responses. By analyzing the status line and response headers, developers can determine the outcome of their requests and process the response data accordingly.

Conditional GET requests allow clients to specify conditions under which they want a server to fulfill their request. This helps in scenarios where clients only need to update their cached copies if the resource has changed since a certain date or if they want to receive a portion of the document instead of the entire content. Common conditional request headers include:

- **If-Modified-Since**: Asks the server to only return the document if it has been modified since the specified date.
- **If-Unmodified-Since**: Requests the document only if it hasn't been modified since the specified date.
- **If-Match**: Asks for the document only if it matches the provided entity tag.
- **If-None-Match**: Requests the document if it doesn't match the provided entity tag.
- **If-Range**: Allows clients to request a specific portion of the document if it matches the provided entity tag; otherwise, it requests the entire document.

These conditional request headers provide clients with more control over how they interact with the server, especially in scenarios where they need to manage cached copies efficiently or retrieve partial content.

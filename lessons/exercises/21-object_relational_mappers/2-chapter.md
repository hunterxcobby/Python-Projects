**Using ORMs in Web Applications:**

1. **Not Mandatory:**
   - Python ORM libraries are not mandatory for interacting with relational databases in web applications.
   - Low-level access to databases is often facilitated by database connectors like psycopg (for PostgreSQL) or MySQL-python (for MySQL).

2. **Role of ORMs:**
   - ORMs provide a higher-level abstraction for working with databases, enabling developers to use Python code instead of direct SQL statements.
   - They are not the only option, and developers can choose to interact with databases using raw SQL or other methods.

3. **Flexibility Across Frameworks:**
   - ORMs, such as SQLAlchemy, offer flexibility by working with various web frameworks and database connectors.
   - Developers can choose the combination that best suits their project requirements.

4. **Web Framework Independence:**
   - ORMs can be used independently of web frameworks. For example, they can be applied in data analysis tools or batch scripts that don't have a web-based user interface.

5. **Connectivity Table Overview:**
   - The provided table illustrates how different Python ORMs can interact with diverse web frameworks, connectors, and relational databases.

6. **Developer Choice:**
   - Developers have the freedom to choose whether to use an ORM or opt for other methods based on the specific needs of their project.
   - Some developers may prefer direct SQL queries or other approaches for database interactions.

Understanding that ORMs are not mandatory opens up possibilities for developers to select the most suitable tools for their projects, considering factors like project requirements, frameworks, and personal preferences.

So I ma learning big o notation as a total beginner and i want you to guide me through step by step of all i need to know about it as a total beginner explaining the concept in depths but to as a new programmer and basinng on this learning objective i give you 
this mini syllables you are about to generate will be based on these two objectives 

What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm

since it might entail a lot you will be generating per chapters and wait for a next prompt from me before moving on to the next chapter 

also so even before we move on to the next chapter i want you to evaluate my progress with a well organized quiz that asks me a question and if i answer it moves to the next one till i tell you that i am good to go now

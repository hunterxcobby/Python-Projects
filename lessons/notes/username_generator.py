```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
```
- This is known as a **shebang line**. It indicates that this script should be executed using the `python3` interpreter located at `/usr/bin/python3`. This is used in Unix-like systems to specify which interpreter should be used to execute the script.

```python
def generate_usernames(first_name, surname):
```
- This line defines a function named `generate_usernames` which takes two parameters: `first_name` and `surname`.

```python
    usernames = set()
```
- This initializes an empty set called `usernames`. A set is a collection of unique elements, and it's used here to store unique username options.

```python
    usernames.add(f"@{first_name[:3].lower()}_{surname[:3].lower()}")
```
- This adds the first username option to the set. It combines the first three characters of `first_name` and `surname` with an underscore in between, converts them to lowercase, and prepends `@`.

```python
    usernames.add(f"@{first_name.lower()}_{surname.lower()}")
```
- This adds a second username option to the set. It uses the full `first_name` and `surname`, converted to lowercase, separated by an underscore, and prepends `@`.

```python
    usernames.add(f"@{first_name[0].lower()}_{surname.lower()}")
```
- This adds a third username option. It uses the first character of `first_name`, converts it to lowercase, and combines it with the full `surname`, also in lowercase, separated by an underscore, and prepends `@`.

```python
    usernames.add(f"@{first_name.lower()}_{surname[:3].lower()}")
```
- This adds a fourth username option. It uses the full `first_name` in lowercase, combines it with the first three characters of `surname` in lowercase, separated by an underscore, and prepends `@`.

```python
    for i in range(1, len(first_name)):
        for j in range(1, len(surname)):
```
- These lines set up nested loops. The outer loop iterates over indices `i` from 1 to the length of `first_name`, and the inner loop iterates over indices `j` from 1 to the length of `surname`.

```python
            usernames.add(f"@{first_name[:i].lower()}_{surname[:j].lower()}")
```
- Inside the loops, this line generates additional username options using slices of `first_name` and `surname`, converting them to lowercase, and combining them with an underscore in between, all prepended with `@`.

```python
            if len(usernames) >= 15:
                return usernames
```
- If the number of generated usernames reaches or exceeds 15, the function returns the set of usernames. This is done to ensure we don't generate too many usernames.

```python
    return usernames
```
- After the loops, if 15 usernames have not yet been generated, the function returns the set of usernames.

```python
first_name = input("First Name: ")
surname = input("Surname: ")
```
- These lines prompt the user for their first name and surname, and assign the input to the variables `first_name` and `surname`.

```python
if first_name and surname:
```
- This line checks if both `first_name` and `surname` are non-empty (i.e., if the user provided both names).

```python
    usernames = generate_usernames(first_name, surname)
```
- If both names are provided, this line calls the `generate_usernames` function with the provided names, and assigns the resulting set of usernames to the variable `usernames`.

```python
    print(f"Your username options are:")
    for username in usernames:
        print(username)
```
- This block of code prints a message indicating that username options are about to be displayed, and then iterates over each username in the `usernames` set, printing them one by one.

```python
else:
    print("Please provide both your first name and surname.")
```
- If either `first_name` or `surname` is empty (i.e., if the user did not provide both names), this line prints a message asking the user to provide both names.

I hope this breakdown helps you understand the code I used in the project. Contact me if you have any further questions!

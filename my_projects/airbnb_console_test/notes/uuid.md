The `uuid` module in Python is used for generating universally unique identifiers, often referred to as UUIDs. UUIDs are 128-bit numbers that are unique across both space and time. They are commonly used in various applications and systems to uniquely identify entities.

To use the `uuid` module in Python, you first need to import it:

```python
import uuid
```

Now, you can generate a UUID using one of the following methods:

1. **uuid1():** This method generates a UUID based on the current timestamp and the machine's hardware address. It may compromise uniqueness if multiple UUIDs are generated within the same 100-nanosecond interval.

    ```python
    my_uuid = uuid.uuid1()
    ```

2. **uuid4():** This method generates a UUID based on random numbers. While not guaranteed to be unique, the probability of collision is extremely low.

    ```python
    my_uuid = uuid.uuid4()
    ```

After generating a UUID, you can convert it to a string for practical use:

```python
uuid_str = str(my_uuid)
```

For example, in the context of an Airbnb clone project, you might use UUIDs to uniquely identify listings, users, or other entities in your system.

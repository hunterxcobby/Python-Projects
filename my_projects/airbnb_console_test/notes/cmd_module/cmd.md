### What's the `Cmd` Class?

The `Cmd` class in Python provides a simple framework for building line-oriented command interpreters. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Purpose:**
   - It's designed for creating command-line interpreters, which are handy for building tools, administrative utilities, or prototypes that might later get a fancier interface.

2. **Class Definition:**
   - `class cmd.Cmd(completekey='tab', stdin=None, stdout=None)`
   - When you create an instance of `Cmd`, you're essentially setting up a framework for handling commands and providing an interactive interface.

3. **Usage:**
   - You typically don't directly use `Cmd` but instead subclass it. By doing this, you inherit the methods provided by `Cmd` and can define your own methods to handle specific commands.

4. **Completion Key:**
   - The `completekey` argument is optional and defaults to 'Tab'. If the `readline` library is available, it enables automatic command completion when the user hits the specified key.

5. **Input and Output:**
   - You can specify input and output file objects using the `stdin` and `stdout` arguments. If not provided, they default to `sys.stdin` and `sys.stdout`.

6. **Raw Input:**
   - If you want to use a specific `stdin`, ensure to set the instance's `use_rawinput` attribute to `False`. This prevents ignoring the specified `stdin`.

### How to Use It:

1. **Subclassing:**
   - You create your own class that inherits from `Cmd`.
   - Define methods in your class for handling specific commands. These methods should follow a naming convention like `do_commandname`.

2. **Command Loop:**
   - Once your class is set up, you start the command loop using the `cmdloop()` method. This prompts the user for input and executes the appropriate method based on the entered command.

Here's a simple example:

```python
import cmd

class MyCmd(cmd.Cmd):
    def do_hello(self, arg):
        print("Hello,", arg)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    my_cmd_instance = MyCmd()
    my_cmd_instance.cmdloop()
```

In this example, typing "hello World" would print "Hello, World."

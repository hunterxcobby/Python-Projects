To make the example code work, you'll need to have a basic understanding of asynchronous programming in Python. Let's break down the code and provide a simple example that you can run and understand:

### Example Code:
```python
# Traditional synchronous approach
result = []
async for i in aiter():
    if i % 2:
        result.append(i)

# Asynchronous comprehension approach
result = [i async for i in aiter() if i % 2]

# Using await expressions in asynchronous comprehension
result = [await fun() for fun in funcs]
```

### Explanation and Example:

1. **Traditional Synchronous Approach**:
   - This code snippet uses an `async for` loop to iterate over an asynchronous iterator `aiter()`.
   - It appends items to the `result` list if they satisfy the condition `i % 2`.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     async def aiter():
         for i in range(10):
             yield i
     
     result = []
     async for i in aiter():
         if i % 2:
             result.append(i)
     print(result)  # Output: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
     ```

2. **Asynchronous Comprehension Approach**:
   - This line constructs a list asynchronously using comprehension syntax.
   - It iterates over an asynchronous iterator `aiter()` and filters items based on the condition `i % 2`.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     result = [i async for i in aiter() if i % 2]
     print(result)  # Output: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
     ```

3. **Using Await Expressions**:
   - This line constructs a list by awaiting the result of asynchronous functions `fun()` for each item in the iterable `funcs`.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     async def fun():
         return 'async_result'
     
     funcs = [fun() for _ in range(3)]  # Creating a list of coroutines
     result = [await f for f in funcs]
     print(result)  # Output: ['async_result', 'async_result', 'async_result']
     ```

### Running the Code:
- Copy the provided example code into a Python script or interactive environment.
- Define the `aiter()` function if you want to test the asynchronous iterator.
- Run the script or execute the code block in your Python environment.
- Observe the output to see how asynchronous comprehensions and await expressions work.

By running and experimenting with this code, you'll gain a practical understanding of asynchronous comprehensions and await expressions in Python.

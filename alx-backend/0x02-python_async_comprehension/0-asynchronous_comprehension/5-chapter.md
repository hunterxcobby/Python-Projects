This part of the PEP outlines the necessary updates to the Python grammar to accommodate asynchronous comprehensions and confirms its compatibility with existing code and its acceptance into Python.

1. **Grammar Updates:**
   - The proposal suggests adding the optional "async" keyword to `comp_for`, the grammar rule for comprehensions. This addition allows for asynchronous comprehensions.
   - Syntax:
     ```plaintext
     comp_for: [ASYNC] 'for' exprlist 'in' or_test [comp_iter]
     ```
   - This change in the grammar ensures that asynchronous comprehensions can be parsed correctly by the Python interpreter.

2. **Backwards Compatibility:**
   - The proposal assures that it is fully backward compatible, meaning that existing code will continue to work as expected without any modifications after the implementation of asynchronous comprehensions.
   - Existing code using synchronous comprehensions won't be affected by the addition of asynchronous comprehensions.

3. **Acceptance:**
   - PEP 530, proposing asynchronous comprehensions, was accepted by Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python, on September 6, 2016.
   - This acceptance signifies that the Python community recognized the value and feasibility of adding asynchronous comprehensions to the language.

4. **Implementation:**
   - The implementation of PEP 530 is tracked in issue 28008.
   - Additionally, a reference implementation is available in a Git repository provided at [2].
   - The implementation details ensure that the proposal is not just theoretical but also practical and ready for integration into Python.

In summary, these sections cover the necessary steps taken to ensure the smooth integration of asynchronous comprehensions into Python, from updating the grammar to tracking implementation progress and ensuring backward compatibility with existing codebases.

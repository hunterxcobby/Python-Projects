In Python 3.6, two significant features were introduced: Asynchronous Comprehensions and Asynchronous Generators. Asynchronous comprehensions allow for the creation of asynchronous list, set, and dict comprehensions, while asynchronous generators enable the creation of asynchronous generator expressions. Let's break down the key points from the provided text:

1. **Syntax for Asynchronous Comprehensions:**
   - Asynchronous comprehensions are denoted by adding the `async` keyword before the `for` statement in a comprehension.
   - Example: `result = [i async for i in aiter() if i % 2]`
   - However, attempting to use asynchronous comprehensions outside of an `async def` function results in a SyntaxError.

2. **Requirement for Asynchronous Comprehensions:**
   - Asynchronous comprehensions are only allowed inside an `async def` function.

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Attempting to directly use `range` in an asynchronous comprehension will result in a TypeError, as `range` does not have an `__aiter__` method.
   - Instead, an asynchronous generator function should be called within the comprehension.

4. **Example of Using Asynchronous Comprehensions:**
   - An example is provided where an asynchronous generator function called `numbers` yields values to an asynchronous list comprehension.
   - The `numbers` function is defined as an asynchronous generator that yields values with a delay using `asyncio.sleep`.

5. **Execution and Handling:**
   - The `main` function is defined as an `async` function, and it contains the asynchronous list comprehension.
   - The event loop is retrieved using `asyncio.get_event_loop()`, and `run_until_complete()` is used to run the `main()` coroutine.

6. **Performance Benefits:**
   - Asynchronous generators are said to be faster than equivalent implementations as asynchronous iterators, according to PEP 525.

In summary, asynchronous comprehensions and generators provide powerful tools for handling asynchronous operations in Python, particularly within the context of `async def` functions. While they may require a different approach compared to synchronous comprehensions, they offer significant benefits, including improved performance and flexibility for asynchronous programming.

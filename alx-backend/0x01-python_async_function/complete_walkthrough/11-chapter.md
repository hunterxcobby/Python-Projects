In conclusion, you have gained an understanding of asynchronous IO (IO) as a language-agnostic model for achieving concurrency through coroutines. You've learned about Python's async and await keywords for defining and working with coroutines, as well as the asyncio package for managing asynchronous operations.

If you're considering which Python version to use for async IO, here's a brief summary of version-specific changes related to asyncio:

- Python 3.3: Introduction of the yield from expression for generator delegation.
- Python 3.4: asyncio introduced to the standard library with provisional API status.
- Python 3.5: async and await keywords added to the Python grammar, though not yet reserved keywords.
- Python 3.6: Introduction of asynchronous generators and comprehensions. asyncio API declared stable.
- Python 3.7: async and await became reserved keywords, and asyncio.run() introduced to the asyncio package, along with other features.

For full support and features, it's recommended to use Python 3.7 or above.
